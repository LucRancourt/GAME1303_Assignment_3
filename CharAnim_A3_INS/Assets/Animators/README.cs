/*
 * The original controller for the character was done using both Left and Right Animations (Left Strafe, Right Strafe, for example)
 * 
 * For whatever reason, the Right side and all its blends look normal.
 * However, the Left side's blends look out of whack, specifically with the walking backwards left (-0.5f, -0.5f)
 * 
 * I may have set something up incorrectly, but I can't seem to figure out what that would be.
 * 
 * So I have included both in the final project - the initial Left/Right 
 * and the all Right (Left side done using the Mirror toggle) 
 * 
 * Left/Right -> Broken
 * All Right -> Working
 *
